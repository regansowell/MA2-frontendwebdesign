        <h4> regan sowell</h4>
      <p> my name is regan sowell and i am 22 years old. i have always had an interest in fashion. having the ability to express yourself through clothes is something i have found important in the past couple of years. i think i have become so much more comfortable in my own skin when wearing things that i think are cool and look good on me. you can tell a lot about someone by the way they present themselves through fashion, and i think that is extremely important. </p>

            <h4> fashion archive </h4>
          <p> the fashion archive is practically just a collection of different fashion pieces that i personally have been intrigued by recently. these are not items i own, although i wish i did, but things that i can grab inspiration from and feel motivated by for the future.  </p>
